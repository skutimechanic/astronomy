/// Specifies a usage aggregation strategy for plans of usage_type=metered. Allowed values are `sum` for summing up all usage during a period, `last_during_period` for picking the last usage record reported within a period, `last_ever` for picking the last usage record ever (across period bounds) or max which picks the usage record with the maximum reported usage during a period. Defaults to `sum`.
